# taxi-project

## A taxi project that is developed in Solidity

You all know that the taxi stations are so expensive and people can't afford it with him/herself.
Imagine a group of people in the same neighborhood who would like to invest into an asset. They cannot invest
individually because each person has a very small amount of money, thus they can combine their holdings together
to invest into a bigger and more profitable investment.
They decided to combine their money and buy a car which will be used as a taxi and the profit will be shared
among participants every month. However, one problem is that they have no trust in each other.

To make this investment work, I wrote a smart contract that will handle the transactions.
